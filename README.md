Problem Sheets For Programming and Scripting
Week 2 Project - Needed to reasearch how to Print request for values, followed by adding the 2 values in cents, then converting to euro and cent in readable format  Reading done: https://pythonguides.com/add-two-numbers-in-python/ https://www.codingem.com/python-how-to-ask-for-user-input/, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-take-integer-input-in-python/, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26218010/how-do-you-get-python-to-ask-the-user-for-an-input-x-amount-of-times, https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/add-number, https://www.adamsmith.haus/python/answers/how-to-format-a-float-as-currency-in-python, https://www.learndatasci.com/solutions/python-double-slash-operator-floor-division/, https://www.learndatasci.com/solutions/python-double-slash-operator-floor-division/
Week 3 Project - Researched how to mask digits in Python, using following link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59342854/how-to-mask-input-and-display-the-last-4-digit-using-python and https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-mask-a-credit-card-number-with-asterisks-in-python
Week 4 project - lots of reading materials and explanations for this one online - easy to follow the logic from the following pages https://medium.com/the-art-of-python/the-collatz-sequence-in-python-eb7e1f1b4f9e and https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-implement-the-collatz-sequence-in-c-and-python - used https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/odd-even to see how to find even number
Week 5 project was tricky as I had a conflict on my machine with the datetime module - it was giving a circular reference. i tried to get the dateime module working using all available resources but to no avail. I eventually deleted my working, then restarted the file without naming it datetime - this resolved the error, I presume there was a conflict with the name of the file and the datetime module. I used the following resources to assist in my completion: https://pynative.com/python-get-the-day-of-week/#:~:text=Use%20the%20now()%20method,string%20into%20a%20datetime%20object.&text=The%20weekday()%20method%20returns,%2C%2002)%20is%20a%20Monday , and https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-datetime-now-how-to-get-todays-date-and-time/
Week 6 project is proving very difficult, I'm struggling to figre it out. I researched Newtons method for approximating square roots however, I left it too late to spend a lot of time on this, I couldn't get the trickeir sides of it to implement, I'll try agai in my spare time during the summer. I found this one to be the most interesting / challenging. Reading I did was as follows https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55232484/newtons-method-for-approximating-square-roots, and https://thirumalai2024.medium.com/python-program-to-find-square-root-of-the-number-using-newtons-method-937c0e732756 
Week 7 project was also very challenging. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-the-number-of-times-a-letter-appears-in-a-text-file-in-python/ showed logic to get the required result https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-read-text-file/ gave me the code to read the text
Week 8 Numpy would not initialise on my machine - there was a conflict and I couldn't import it. So I couldn't verify if this code works or not - I used the resource at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-normal-distribution-over-histogram-in-python/ to get to my starting point, but then couldn't go any further. Original error code was "import "numpy" could not be resolved pylace(reportmissingimports)" so after a bit of research i saw that I could manually add it, this didn't work either. Numpy it seems is installed on my machine in the Anaconda folder, but I couldn't get it to pull over to VSCode.

Overall, I found the first 4 projects fairly manageable with a bit of research, but the last 3 have shown that I need to do a good bit more work.
